    <h1>Information About CSS</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a crucial web development technology used to control the visual presentation of
         HTML documents. By defining rules that target HTML elements, specifying properties like colors, fonts, and 
         layouts, and utilizing the box model, CSS separates content and structure from design, enabling the creation of
          aesthetically pleasing and responsive web pages. CSS leverages selectors, properties, values, and cascading 
          rules to maintain design consistency and adapt to various screen sizes, making it an essential tool for ach
          ieving a cohesive and user-friendly web experience. Additionally, CSS3 and ongoing CSS specifications continua
          lly expand the possibilities for web design, while CSS preprocessors and frameworks offer enhanced efficiency 
          and maintainability.</p>
